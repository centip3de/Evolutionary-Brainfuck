This project aims to allow Brainfuck programs to 'evolve', or change their own code randomly and compare it to a set of tests to check for improvement. Further, this project aims to allow for 'ancestries', passing down 'genes', and types of 'species'. The code will be written from scratch in C++ only using the standard library.
